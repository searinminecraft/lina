A [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat) bot focused on SuperTuxKart. Get addon information, player rankings, search for users, servers, and more with this bot!

Based on ~~and stolen from~~ the code from [doingus](https://github.com/searinminecraft/doingus). And I kinda consider this doingus' sister.

## Features

* Search for servers
* Get currently online servers (aka if server has players in it)
* Search for users (Max results is 50. It's a limitaion on STK servers)
* Get addon information (only tracks for now)
* A game that makes you guess what addon it is based on the image it gives you.
* Get player rankings (Only top 10 players for now)
* "PokeMap" system: A Pokemon-like mechanic where you "catch" and collect addons.

## How to set up

(WIP)
